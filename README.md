# System-analysis-and-design-255

The DriverPass project involved designing a system for a client that needed an efficient way to manage driving lesson scheduling. The goal was to create a system where students could register, book lessons, and modify their schedules while ensuring administrators and instructors could manage their responsibilities. One aspect I did particularly well was creating clear and well-structured UML diagrams, which made it easier to visualize the system's workflow. If I could revise one part of my work, I would refine the class diagram to improve relationships between objects, ensuring the system design is as clear and efficient as possible. Understanding user needs played a big role in my design, as I focused on making the system easy to use and accessible, which is crucial for a smooth user experience. Moving forward, I would continue using techniques like user feedback, iterative design, and structured modeling to analyze and build future systems effectively.
